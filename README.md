# Shape-Detection-OpenCV-Python
This project implements the shape decetion using OpenCV. The program performs by identifying the contours of an input image. The program uses Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm (which is approxPolyDP() in OpenCV), which is used to calculate the outline of the shape. Cheers :)
